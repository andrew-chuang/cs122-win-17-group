They are delicious. Simply crafted- cooked to perfection and carefully dressed with a creamy sauce and pickles. If you don't get the burger at Au Cheval, you're not doing it right. \n\nThe fries have perfect texture- crispy while maintaining the integrity of a soft potatoey inside. They're served with garlic aoli. The tang and creaminess of the sauce marries so well with that classic french fry flavor and crunch. \n\nIf you're looking to lighten up you meal, I would highly recommend the green salad. It was simple- lettuce served with a pickled shallot, herb, and sherry vinagrette. A refreshing contrast to the heaviness of the other menu items. If it comes down to salad or fries, I think I'd even go with the salad because it was that good. \n\nWe arrived around 5 on a Friday night and had a short 30-45 minute wait.

Finally that box is checked! Navigating the wait to get in is the tricky part but we managed to finagle a 90 minute wait vs a more typical 2-3 hour stint with some strategic planning in this small space. \n\nThe cocktails are really good here, which helps the wait time. Their burgers are pretty spectacular. The single has 2 perfectly cooked juicy patties, American cheese, pickles & their own special sauce served on maybe the best brioche hamburger bun ever. The meat to bun ratio is perfect however about halfway through I found the sauce to be a tad one note & added a little ketchup, much to the horror of my dining companions. Hey if they didn't want me to use ketchup, why did they put the bottle on the table? We also split a salad, fries, and got the bread & butter pickles. \n\nDefinitely one of the best burgers I've ever eaten & the bun was killer!

Heard a lot about this place, the double stacked burger as the best you'll ever eat, the long waits, the cool vibe in such a small place. \n\nTried to get in on Saturday as the kitchen opened at 5. They don't take reservations so you need to get your name on a list and they'll text you. Told there was a 3 hour wait. Too long for me to wait for any burger. Came back Sunday and was able to order in just under 90 minutes from arrival. Enjoyed some great cocktails as we waited - an unexpected bonus!\n\nIs it the best burger I've ever had? No, but it is certainly near the top. Don't know how they pack so much flavor into that double patty stack on an incredibly tasty bun. But they do. Cooked medium/medium rare it just bursts with flavor. A taste sensation indeed. And that bun alone is worth stopping in for!! Wow. Not worth a 3 hour wait but it certainly is a place you need to try.

I'm not a burger person, but this burger was literally the best I've had in my entire life.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday night and were surprised with a 3 hour wait (they do not take reservations). So we decided to come back Monday for lunch and the wait was only 30 minutes (they actually sent me a text 10 minutes later - yay!). We were seated at the bar and I was fascinated by how the chefs cooked the orders. We ordered a single burger (no cheese) with fried egg (+$2), a double cheeseburger with fried egg (+$2) and thick cut bacon (+$3.50), and crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and fried egg. We also got a canned beer and the Flapper cocktail drink. \n\nDo yourself a favor and don't wear a sweater because this food will fire you up. The single burger actually comes with two thin patties and the double burger comes with three. The patties were cooked medium/medium rare, the way they taste best. The fried eggs were cooked to perfection and bacon was sweet, perfectly crispy and just the right amount of fat. Together, the burger was just the ultimate combo. The burger order doesn't come with any sides except a dill pickle. Don't underestimate this dill pickle though, because after a very tasty yet heavy burger, the acidity in the dill pickle will make you feel a lot better about yourself. The crispy fries were a little too crispy for my liking, but the sauces were delicious! The Flapper is gin, pepper, lemon, honey and fernet - sharp, crisp and refreshing.\n\nThere are so many other unique menu items I would love to try if I'm ever back in Chicago.", "author": "Alyssa W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-08", "description": "I'd been hearing about this place for months from  many people. So on a trip to Chicago, I trucked over here through the snow on a Sunday night.\n\nTo start, be prepared for a insanely long wait anytime you come here. I came on a Sunday afternoon and the line was out the door into the snow, so I came back Sunday evening and \"only had to wait 40 minutes\". I grabbed a seat at the bar.\n\nLet's get straight to the point, the burger is excellent. I had the single cheeseburger with no runny egg and an order of fries, and it was sick. The biggest standout about the burger is the sauce. It has a powerful taste that reminds me of the sauce used on a big Mac. The end result is a burger that has a fast food taste, but with a gourmet twist. Delicious. \n\nThe restaurant is more like a blue collar diner and there isn't a lot of seating. Once you're in, things moves very quickly, so figure out what you want and order. They also serve drinks here and a bunch of wines. I had a nice glass of red with my burger.\n\nAll in all, this place is a must if in Chicago. I can't say it's the best burger I've ever had, but it's top three for sure.

Not just the food, but also the space, the vibe, the energy, the music, the drinks, the crowd, the decor, the noise level, the ambiance, the service. Also I had no wait which I guess is pretty unusual and adds to the pleasure. The waitress was so great, she was always there to ask if everything was ok and bring whatever. Sorry I can't review the burger because I didn't have room. I ordered a burger but also chopped liver to start and then couldn't pile a burger on top. The chopped liver was so rich and delicious along with buttered toast and a stack of cornichons, which were the perfect foil. It was coarsely chopped, perfectly seasoned and contained some dill, I think. The beverage choice is huge; I had a glass of champagne and a hefeweissbier.\n\nLove the menu. Brendan failed once, with his deli concept, Dillman's. Now at Au Cheval we find matzoh ball soup, chopped liver, omelets and hash browns.

Minus that .5 because of a little mishap with putting our name down.\n\nBestie and I came met up with a friend of hers here around 5 on a rainy Monday night. He arrived first and put us down for 3. Host said the wait would be 40mins-1hr. Decided to trek a couple blocks to the monster toy door for fun. Came back and waited. After basically waiting an hour and not being called, we checked in at the stand to find out our names weren't even down and never received a confirmation text even though we gave a number. It was upsetting and we were put on the list for real this time and got a confirmation text. Went to Whole Foods and my friends had a drink at the bar. From the confirmation we were able to see how many people were ahead of us, which was nice.It went down pretty fast, we're guessing people dipped out because of the wait. We waited roughly another hour before we were seated. We ordered...\n\n-bone marrow ($17.95): Came with 4 pieces of marrow, bread, and marmalade. This was bestie and her friend's first time trying bone marrow. They weren't impressed but were glad to have tried. I enjoyed it a lot. I really liked the marmalade that it came with.\n\n-single cheese burger($10.95): Best and I split a burger. We added an egg ($1) and the famous bacon ($3.50). Even though it was a single, it came with two patties! The bacon was pretty darn good but adding it on for the price only gave you two small pieces. :(\n\n-fries($5.95) Fries were yum. I kept the marmalade from the bone marrow and dipped my fries in it :3\n\n-smashed potato(5.95): If you like mashed potatoes, Get it, they're good!\n\nService overall was great!

Alright, let's just start with the hype is real. Yes, you're going to have to wait a bit and maybe even awhile to get a seat, but I gotta say that was one damn good burger!\n\nAfter two years of living out here and frequent visits to Chicago over the past 5 years, I finally made it out to Au Cheval. Showed up just past 4pm on a Monday afternoon, as I've heard via word of mouth that the work crowd starts to show around 4:30pm and after that you can expect to wait hours on hours. We put in our name for two and the hostess let us know that our table would be ready within the hour and they would text us. Score. We ended up going to  Lone Wolf next door since the bar seating at Au Cheval was completely full. About half way through our first round and we get the text that they're ready for us. \n\nThe restaurant itself isn't that much bigger than a diner. The use of darker woods and low lights on the inside gave it a casual/classy ambiance and I was totally feeling the 80s & 90s throwback jams that they were bumping. Waiter was prompt to bring out menus and a decent selection of craft beers to choose from on tap which I had noticed initially from the lines of taps at the barfront near the entrance. I ended up going with a smuttynose robust porter which was pretty tasty, but filling at the same time. For food, we did an order of general jane's honey-fried chicken w/ chili, sesame seeds, & cilantro. My oh my that was some fried goodness. Sticky, sweet, spicy and perfectly fried chicken. Thank goodness they bring it out with moist towels to wipe yourself after because who uses a knife and fork to eat fried chicken. Not me! \n\nOf course we did their burgers for the main entree/finale, a single cheeseburger for her and a double cheeseburger for me. Now let me just say here at Au Cheval, a single = two patties and a double = three patties. Had I known this ahead of time, a \"single cheeseburger\" would've served me well. We both opted for a fried egg and their extra thick cut bacon. By the time I stacked my burger, it could've been mistaken for a quadruple cheeseburger. How'd it taste you say? I've never had a burger with that amount of richness & juiciness and that fried egg and bacon just puts it over the top. In short, BEST BURGER EVER.  \n\nI'll leave it at that.

I expected a 1-2 hour wait, but was told I would be seated \"within the hour.\" I put my name in (and phone number, as their waitlist was powered by Nowait), and headed next door for a beer to kill time. Au Cheval has a bar too but it's a relatively small restaurant and the bar was overly crowded.\n\nI barely put my lips on my beer glass when I got a notification that my table was ready! I looked down - barely 15 minutes. Not bad, not bad. I quickly finished my beer and headed back to the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered: the chicken wings, a double cheeseburger, and a single cheeseburger. Of course we got eggs and bacon on the burgers.\n\nThe wings: The only slightly disappointing thing we tasted. The wings were good, but a little overly sweet. The thing that I wasn't a fan of though? If you're going to charge $17.99 for six chicken wings, they better be DAMN GOOD. These were good, just not anything to brag about.\n\nThe burgers. Holy goodness were these things bigger than expected. And rich. the bacon gave the whole thing a sense of umami. The egg - perfect. And the patties? Well, the \"single\" burger was really composed of two patties, so that was a pleasant surprise.

Super rich though, would recommend sharing\n\n- bologna sandwich- so this was a little too salty for me but went over well at the table... made me a little nostalgic for the fried bologna sandwiches my dad used to make me as a kid \n\n- fries - yep they're good... I actually prefer the plain fries with garlic aioli to the version with mornay/egg but all versions are good... \n\n- burger- so the star of the show... My favorite version of this is the basic single cheeseburger, nothing added... It's the perfect amount of meat/cheese/sauce/toasted bun that comes together deliciously to be one of the best burgers period... However I do change it up at times- egg when I'm feeling super indulgent (as if the cheeseburger alone isn't enough)... last time it was all in with a double- this was too much for me (shocking I know) but now I can say I've tried the full array of options before deciding on a fav\n\n- dessert - yup there was more ( everything was shared, stop judging) ...
