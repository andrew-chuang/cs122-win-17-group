Outline of Yelp API and Web Scraping

There are two main APIs within the Yelp API that will be useful to us: the Businesses API and the Search API. 

----Business API
Each business is associated with a string business ID ('au-cheval-chicago'). The business API consists of a function, get_business, that takes a business ID and returns an object containing information about the business. This information includes:
- basic identifying information
- average rating
- location details
- current deals
- one review for the business and review details]


----Search API
There are three functions in the Search API: search, search_by_bounding_box, and search_by_coordinates

--search()
- Takes a general term (as used in any Yelp search)
- Takes a category filter, or business category (extensive list provided in API)
- Returns same information as get_business()

############## Web Scraping

When a search is made on the Yelp site, the URL can be re-used for other search terms as we did in the Web Scraping Lab. On the business page for a restaraunt, all the reviews are contained in a single dictionary/JSON object. It contains the stars, the review date, and the text of the review - but it does NOT contain the userID of the reviewer.
