Outline of Yelp API 

There are two main APIs within the Yelp API that will be useful to us: the Businesses API and the Search API. 

----Business API
Each business is associated with a string business ID ('au-cheval-chicago'). The business API consists of a function, get_business, that takes a business ID and returns an object containing information about the business. This information includes:
- basic identifying infoarmation
- average rating
- location details
- current deals
- one review for the business and review details]


----Search API
There are three functions in the Search API: search, search_by_bounding_box, and search_by_coordinates

--search()
- Takes a general term (as used in any Yelp search)
- Takes a category filter, or business category (extensive list provided in API)
- Returns same information as get_business()
